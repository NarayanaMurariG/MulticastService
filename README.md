# MulticastService
Developed a causally ordered multicasting service and a unordered multicast

## Unordered Multicast
1) The syntax is ./Unordered processNumber
2) Execute each process in seperate terminal window
3) Try to execute all processes simultaneously within 1-2 seconds

Ex :<br/>
./Unordered 1 (In terminal 1)<br/>
./Unordered 2 (In terminal 2)<br/> 
./Unordered 3 (In terminal 3)<br/> 

## Ordered Multicast
1) The syntax is ./CausalOrdered processNumber
2) Execute each process in seperate terminal window
3) Try to execute all processes simultaneously within 1-2 seconds

Ex :<br/>
./CausalOrdered 1 (In terminal 1)<br/>
./CausalOrdered 2 (In terminal 2)<br/>
./CausalOrdered 3 (In terminal 3)<br/>
