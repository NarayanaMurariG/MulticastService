# MulticastService
Developed a causally ordered multicasting service and a unordered multicast

## Unordered Multicast
1) The syntax is ./Unordered processNumber
2) Execute each process in seperate terminal window
3) Try to execute all processes simultaneously within 1-2 seconds

Ex :
./Unordered 1 (In terminal 1). 
./Unordered 2 (In terminal 2). 
./Unordered 3 (In terminal 3). 

## Ordered Multicast
1) The syntax is ./CausalOrdered processNumber
2) Execute each process in seperate terminal window
3) Try to execute all processes simultaneously within 1-2 seconds

Ex :
./CausalOrdered 1 (In terminal 1). 
./CausalOrdered 2 (In terminal 2). 
./CausalOrdered 3 (In terminal 3).
